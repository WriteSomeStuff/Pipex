# Pipex - @Codam
A project to practice using the fork/pipe functions, handle redirections, open/close file descriptors and learn about child/parent processes.

## How does it work?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WriteSomeStuff/Pipex.git
cd Pipex
make
./pipex filename1 command1 command2 filename2
```
